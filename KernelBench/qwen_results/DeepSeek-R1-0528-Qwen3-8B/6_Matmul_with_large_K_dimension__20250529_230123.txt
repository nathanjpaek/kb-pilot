We are given a PyTorch model that does:
  1. A linear transformation (Gemm)
  2. Element-wise multiplication by a scalar
  3. LeakyReLU activation

We need to optimize this using TileLang kernels. The reference example shows how to optimize a matmul with TileLang.

Steps:
1. We'll create a TileLang kernel for the Gemm operation (matrix multiplication) similar to the reference example.
2. We'll create a kernel for the element-wise multiplication (though this might be trivial and can be done with TileLang's element-wise operations).
3. We'll create a kernel for the LeakyReLU activation.

However, note that the reference example only shows a matmul kernel. We can break down the operations:

- The linear layer (Gemm) can be optimized with a TileLang matmul kernel.
- The element-wise multiplication can be done with a simple TileLang loop.
- The LeakyReLU can be implemented with a conditional in TileLang.

But note: The reference example uses a kernel that is built with specific dimensions (M, N, K) and uses shared memory and pipelined stages for performance.

We'll create a ModelNew class that:
- In __init__: We'll define the necessary kernels (matmul, mul, leaky_relu) using TileLang.
- In forward: We'll use these kernels to perform the operations.

However, note that the original model has a linear layer (which is a Gemm) and then a scalar multiplication and LeakyReLU.

We can break down the operations:

1. Linear layer: A Gemm (matrix multiplication) of input x (shape [batch_size, in_features]) with the weight matrix (shape [out_features, in_features]).
   But note: The original model uses nn.Linear, which does: x @ weight.T. However, in the forward we have:
        x = self.gemm(x)   # This is equivalent to x @ weight.T

   But in our TileLang matmul kernel, we typically do A (MxK) @ B (KxN) -> C (MxN). So we need to set:
        A = x (shape [batch_size, in_features]) -> M = batch_size, K = in_features
        B = weight (shape [out_features, in_features]) -> K = in_features, N = out_features

   However, note that the original model's linear layer is defined as:
        self.gemm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

   So the weight matrix is of shape (out_features, in_features). We can use our matmul kernel by setting:
        A = x (shape [batch_size, in_features])
        B = weight (shape [out_features, in_features])
        Then C will be of shape [batch_size, out_features]

   But wait: the matmul kernel expects A to be (M, K) and B to be (K, N). So we have:
        M = batch_size, K = in_features, N = out_features.

   However, the weight matrix is (out_features, in_features) so we need to transpose it? Actually, in the linear layer, we do x @ weight.T, so we can either:
        Option 1: Transpose the weight matrix and then use the matmul kernel with A = x and B = weight.T.
        Option 2: Use the matmul kernel without transpose and set B as the weight matrix but then the dimensions would be (in_features, out_features) and then we would have to adjust the kernel.

   But note: The reference matmul kernel is for A (MxK) @ B (KxN) -> C (MxN). So if we want to do x (batch_size, in_features) @ weight (out_features, in_features).T (which is (in_features, out_features)), then we set:
        A = x (M = batch_size, K = in_features)
        B = weight.T (K = in_features, N = out_features)

   Alternatively, we can change the kernel to do the transpose internally? But the reference kernel doesn't do that.

   Let's stick to the standard matmul kernel and use the transpose.

   However, note that the original model does not require the weight to be transposed in the kernel call. We can handle the transpose in the forward method.

   But wait: The original model's linear layer is defined with nn.Linear, which does the transpose. We are replacing that with a TileLang matmul. So we need to provide the weight matrix in the correct shape.

   We can do:

        weight = self.weight.t()   # This would be (in_features, out_features)

   But then the matmul kernel expects A (M, K) and B (K, N). So if we set:
        A = x (M = batch_size, K = in_features)
        B = weight (K = in_features, N = out_features)

   Then the result is (batch_size, out_features). This matches the linear layer.

   Alternatively, we can keep the weight as (out_features, in_features) and then set B to be the weight without transpose, but then we would have to change the kernel to do A @ B.t()? That would be less efficient.

   Let's do the first option: transpose the weight and then use the standard matmul kernel.

2. After the matmul, we multiply by a scalar (multiplier). This is an element-wise operation. We can use a simple TileLang loop for this.

3. Then we apply LeakyReLU. We can use a TileLang loop with a conditional.

But note: The reference example uses a kernel that is built with specific dimensions (M, N, K) and uses shared memory and pipelined stages for performance. We need to do the same for the matmul.

However, the element-wise operations (mul and leaky_relu) are not as performance-critical and can be done with simple loops.

Let's design:

- Matmul kernel: We'll use a similar kernel to the reference example, but with the ability to specify the dimensions (M, N, K) and data types.

- Mul kernel: A simple element-wise multiplication.

- LeakyReLU kernel: A simple element-wise activation.

But note: The original model has a multiplier and negative_slope as parameters. We need to pass these to the kernels.

We'll create:

    class ModelNew(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, multiplier, negative_slope):
            super().__init__()
            # We'll define the kernels here, but note that the kernel building function requires the dimensions at compile time.
            # However, the dimensions (in_features, out_features) are known at compile time because they are provided in __init__.
            # But the input tensor dimensions (batch_size) are not known until runtime. So we cannot compile the kernel until we know the input shape.

            # We can use the same caching mechanism as in the reference example: cache kernels by their input dimensions and data type.

            # We'll create a method to build the matmul kernel, and then cache it by (M, N, K) and dtype.

            # But note: The matmul kernel requires M, N, K. M and N are the output dimensions? Actually, in our case:
            #   For the matmul: A is (batch_size, in_features) and B is (in_features, out_features) -> so M = batch_size, K = in_features, N = out_features.
            #   But the kernel is built with (M, N, K) as arguments? Actually, the reference kernel is built with (M, N, K) but the kernel function uses M, N, K as the dimensions of the matrices.

            # Let's look at the reference kernel:
            #   _build_matmul_kernel(M, N, K, ...) -> the kernel function takes A (M, K), B (K, N), C (M, N)

            # So in our case, we want to compute C = A @ B.t()? Actually, no: we want to compute C = A @ B, but with B being the weight matrix (which is (out_features, in_features)) and we are using B.t()? 

            # Actually, we decided to transpose the weight. So the weight matrix is stored as (in_features, out_features). Then the matmul is A (batch_size, in_features) @ B (in_features, out_features) -> (batch_size, out_features).

            # So the kernel parameters are:
            #   M = batch_size, K = in_features, N = out_features.

            # But note: The kernel building function requires the dimensions at compile time. However, the batch_size is variable. So we cannot compile the kernel until we know the batch_size.

            # We'll use the same caching mechanism as in the reference example: cache kernels by (M, N, K) and dtype.

            # However, the batch_size (M) is variable. We can still cache by (M, N, K) but note that M is the batch_size and can be any value. We might have many different batch sizes.

            # Alternatively, we can use a different approach: the kernel building function can be parameterized by M, N, K. We'll build the kernel once for a given (M, N, K) and dtype.

            # But note: The reference example builds the kernel with M, N, K as arguments and returns a compiled kernel that can be called with tensors of those dimensions.

            # We'll do the same.

            # Steps in forward:
            #   - Get the input x (shape [batch_size, in_features])
            #   - Get the weight matrix (shape [out_features, in_features]) and transpose it to [in_features, out_features]
            #   - Then call the matmul kernel with (batch_size, in_features, out_features) and the transposed weight.

            # But wait: the matmul kernel expects A (M, K) and B (K, N). So we set:
            #   A = x (shape [batch_size, in_features]) -> M = batch_size, K = in_features
            #   B = weight.t() (shape [in_features, out_features]) -> K = in_features, N = out_features

            # Then the result is (batch_size, out_features)

            # Then we do element-wise multiplication by multiplier and then LeakyReLU.

        def forward(self, x):
            # ... 

But note: The original model also has a multiplier and negative_slope as parameters. We need to pass these to the element-wise kernels.

We'll create:

    matmul_kernel = _build_matmul_kernel(M, N, K, dtype, accum_dtype)

But note: The reference kernel uses a specific block configuration. We'll use the same.

However, the reference kernel uses:
    block_M=128, block_N=128, block_K=32

We'll keep that.

But note: The reference kernel uses float16 for input and accum_dtype float. We'll use the same.

But the original model uses float16 for the linear layer? The input is torch.float16.

We'll assume the input and weight are float16.

Now, let's write the code:

We'll create a function to build the matmul kernel, then a function to build the mul kernel, and a function to build the leaky_relu kernel.

But note: The element-wise operations are simple and can be done without shared memory. We can use a simple loop.

However, for performance, we might want to use tiling and parallelism. But for simplicity, we'll do a simple element-wise kernel.

But note: The requirement is to use TileLang kernels. We can use the T.ternary operation for LeakyReLU? Actually, TileLang doesn't have a built-in LeakyReLU, but we can implement it with a conditional.

Let's break down:

1. Matmul kernel: We'll use the reference kernel.

2. Mul kernel: We'll create a kernel that does element-wise multiplication. We can use a simple loop:

        @tilelang.jit(out_idx=-1)
        @T.prim_func
        def mul_kernel(A: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype), B: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype), C: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype)):
            with T.Kernel(T.ceildiv(M, block_M), T.ceildiv(N, block_N), threads=128) as (bx, by):
                # We need to define the local grid and block dimensions. But for simplicity, we'll use a simple loop without tiling for the element-wise operation.

                # Actually, we can use a simple loop without shared memory because it's element-wise.

                # But note: We want to use TileLang's parallelism. We can use a grid of blocks and threads.

                # Let's define block size and grid size.

                # We'll use a simple kernel that just does:
                #   for i in range(M):
                #       for j in range(N):
                #           C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]

                # But we need to map this to TileLang's parallel execution.

                # We can do:

                #   T.ternary or T.if_condition? Actually, we can use a simple loop with T.grid.

                # Let's use:

                #   @T.prim_func
                #   def mul_kernel(A: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype), B: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype), C: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype)):
                #       for i in range(M):
                #           for j in range(N):
                #               C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]

                # But this is not parallel. We need to use T.Kernel and T.grid.

                # We can do:

                #   with T.Kernel(M, N, threads=128) as (i, j):
                #       C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]

                # But note: The kernel must be launched with a grid. We can use T.ceildiv to compute the grid.

                # Alternatively, we can use:

                #   @tilelang.jit(out_idx=-1)
                #   @T.prim_func
                #   def mul_kernel(A: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype), B: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype), C: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype)):
                #       with T.Kernel(T.ceildiv(M, block_size), T.ceildiv(N, block_size), threads=block_size) as (bx, by):
                #           i = by * block_size + T.thread_id()
                #           if i < M and bx < T.ceildiv(M, block_size):
                #               for j in range(N):
                #                   C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]

                # But note: We are using a 2D grid and 1D thread indexing. This is acceptable.

                # However, for simplicity and performance, we can use a 2D block and grid.

                # Let's set block_size to 128 and use 2D indexing.

                # But note: The reference matmul kernel uses a 2D grid and 2D thread indexing. We can do the same for mul.

                # We'll use:

                #   block_size = 128
                #   with T.Kernel(T.ceildiv(M, block_size), T.ceildiv(N, block_size), threads=block_size) as (bx, by):
                #       i = by * T.block_size + T.thread_id_in_grid_dim(0)
                #       j = bx * T.block_size + T.thread_id_in_grid_dim(1)
                #       if i < M and j < N:
                #           C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]

                # But wait: The kernel function parameters are (bx, by) and then we use T.thread_id_in_grid_dim. Actually, in TileLang, we can use T.grid to define the grid and then use T.thread_id().

                # Let me check the TileLang documentation: We can use:

                #   with T.Kernel(grid_M, grid_N, threads=128) as (bx, by):
                #       i = bx * block_size + T.thread_id()
                #       if i < M and by < grid_N:   # Actually, the grid is defined by (grid_M, grid_N) and we have two dimensions.

                # But note: The kernel function parameters are (bx, by) and we are using a 2D grid. We need to map the 2D grid to the 2D indices.

                # Alternatively, we can use:

                #   with T.Kernel(M, N, threads=128) as (i, j):
                #       C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]

                # But this is not parallel. We need to use a grid.

                # Let's use a 2D grid with block size 128 and grid size (ceil(M/128), ceil(N/128)).

                # We'll do:

                #   grid_M = T.ceildiv(M, 128)
                #   grid_N = T.ceildiv(N, 128)
                #   with T.Kernel(grid_M, grid_N, threads=128) as (bx, by):
                #       i = bx * 128 + T.thread_id()
                #       j = by * 128 + T.thread_id()   # Wait, this is not correct because the thread_id is 1D.

                # Actually, in TileLang, the thread_id is a single integer. We need to split it into two dimensions.

                # We can do:

                #   tid = T.thread_id()
                #   bx = tid // 128
                #   by = tid % 128

                # But then we have to check bx and by against the grid dimensions.

                # Alternatively, we can use:

                #   with T.Kernel(grid_M, grid_N, threads=128) as (bx, by):
                #       i = bx * 128 + T.thread_id_in_dim(0)
                #       j = by * 128 + T.thread_id_in_dim(1)

                # But note: The kernel function parameters are (bx, by) and we are using two dimensions. The grid is 2D.

                # Actually, the kernel function parameters are the grid dimensions. So we can do:

                #   with T.Kernel(grid_M, grid_N, threads=128) as (bx, by):
                #       i = bx * 128 + T.thread_id_in_dim(0)
                #       j = by * 128 + T.thread_id_in_dim(1)

                # But wait, the kernel function parameters are the grid dimensions, so bx goes from 0 to grid_M-1 and by from 0 to grid_N-1.

                # Then we can compute:

                #   i =
