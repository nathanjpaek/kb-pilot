We are given a PyTorch model that does:
 1. A linear layer (gemm) : A = A @ W + b, but note that in the given example, the linear layer is followed by multiplication and then LeakyReLU.
 However, note the provided model is:

 class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, multiplier, negative_slope):
        super().__init__()
        self.gemm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
        self.multiplier = multiplier
        self.leaky_relu = nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.gemm(x)
        x = x * self.multiplier
        x = self.leaky_relu(x)
        return x

 We are to optimize this model with TileLang.

 However, note that the input to the linear layer is (batch_size, in_features) and the output is (batch_size, out_features)

 Steps to do:

 1. Replace the linear layer operation (which is a matrix multiplication) with a TileLang optimized kernel.

 2. Note that after the linear layer, we multiply by a scalar (multiplier) and then apply LeakyReLU.

 3. We must handle the input and output shape: (batch_size, in_features) vs. (in_features, out_features) because the linear layer does: x @ W (then plus b) but without the bias we are ignoring (the example Linear layer does have bias? Actually, the standard nn.Linear does include bias, but in the provided code, the bias term is not being used. However, note the problem: the original model does include the bias in the linear layer. But in the problem statement, the example model might not have the bias. However, looking at the given example, the model is defined as:

    self.gemm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

 which internally does x @ W + b.

 But in the forward method, we are not subtracting the bias? Actually, yes, the Linear layer does include the bias. Let's not change the functionality.

 However, note: The example does not show the bias being used. But the original model definition includes the bias. Since we are only required to match the input/output, we must include the bias if it's in the model.

 But wait: the provided model definition in the task does not include the bias as an argument to nn.Linear, but the forward method multiplies by a scalar and then applies LeakyReLU. The model that we are to optimize is:

    class Model(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, multiplier, negative_slope):
            super().__init__()
            self.gemm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
            ... 

        def forward(...):
            x = self.gemm(x)   # this includes bias if present in Linear layer
            ... 

 Actually, the example does not specify whether the Linear layer uses bias. However, note that the original model's output is:

    x = self.gemm(x)
    x = x * self.multiplier
    x = self.leaky_relu(x)

 The original model will work for both with and without bias because the Linear layer option for bias is True by default. 

 But the task says: "Focus on replacing PyTorch operators with efficient TileLang implementations", so we are to replace the linear operation (matmul) and the following elementwise multiply and LeakyReLU.

 However, LeakyReLU is a pure activation function and can be handled by an elementwise kernel.

 So, the task has two parts:

 Part 1: Optimize the linear layer (matrix multiplication) in the middle of the network.

 Part 2: The elementwise operations (multiply and LeakyReLU) are sequential.

 Since we are using TileLang, we can optimize the entire forward pass by:
   - Optimized the gemm (linear layer) using a TileLang GEMM kernel.
   - Then, we can write a TileLang kernel for the elementwise multiply and activation.

 But note: the input to the linear layer is (batch_size, in_features) and the weight matrix is (out_features, in_features). We must transpose the weight matrix if we are doing a standard GEMM.

 However, let me clarify the operation:

   y = torch.nn.functional.linear(x, weight, bias)   # without bias, or with bias

   where y has shape (batch_size, out_features)

   So, the operation is: y = x @ weight.T + bias, if bias is not None.

 But note: the standard linear layer in PyTorch is defined as:

   y = matmul(x, weight.t()) + bias

 So, we want to optimize:

   C = M = A @ B^T

   where A is (batch_size, in_features) and B (transposed) is (in_features, out_features) but wait:

   Actually, the weight matrix in the linear layer has shape (out_features, in_features). So, the operation is:

   output = torch.nn.functional.linear(input, weight, bias = None)

   and the linear function is:

   output = input @ weight.T + bias

   So, the kernel should implement: C = A @ B^T, where A is (M, K) and B^T is (K, N) and we are computing (M, N).

 However, note the input shape is (batch_size, in_features) and the weight shape is (out_features, in_features). 

 So, to compute the linear layer, we do:

   x = input  # (B, M)
   W = weight # (O, M)
   output = x @ W.t()   # (B, O) 

 But note: this is not the typical matrix multiplication kernel. The typical tensor contraction is:

   output = torch.einsum('ijk->ik', ...) doesn't apply.

   Actually, it is: (B, M) @ (O, M) -> (B, O)

   So we are performing: out_b_o = sum_m in_features: in_b_m * W_o_m

   This is a Gemm with A being (B, M) and B being (O, M) and C being (B, O). We can use the standard tilegemm but note: the matrix multiplication is not transpose.

   Actually, in the example provided for matmul, we have: C = A @ B, with A(M,K) and B(K,N). Our case is similar if we set:

      A = x (shape (B, M)), B = W.t() (shape (M, O))

   Then we are computing C = A @ B with shape (B, O).

   However, note: in the standard tile language, we often use the "general" matrix multiplication where we have two matrices and we can choose the order. But the LeakyReLU and multiply are elementwise and cannot be fused with the GEMM in terms of transform, so we have to do the GEMM.

   Therefore, we can build a TileLang kernel for a Gemm of the form:

      C = A @ B.t()

   But note: our kernel building function for matmul in the example was for the form:

      C = A @ B   (without transpose)

   In our case, we are doing:

      C = A @ B.t()

   So we have two options:

      Option 1: Use a standard matmul kernel and set B as the transposed matrix (then we don't need to transpose in the kernel)

      Option 2: Use a kernel that does a Gemm with A and B.t().

   Actually, let me clarify: the example matmul kernel was for a kernel that does:

      @T.prim_func
      def matmul_kernel(
          A: T.Tensor((M, K), dtype),
          B: T.Tensor((K, N), dtype),
          C: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype),
      ):

   In our case, we have:

      A = (batch_size, in_features)   -> we can call this M, K = batch_size, in_features
      B = weight (out_features, in_features) but in the Gemm we are doing A @ B.t(), so we can set:

          A = (batch_size, in_features)
          B_transposed = (in_features, out_features)

      Then we compute C = A @ B_transposed with shape (batch_size, out_features)

   So we can use the same matmul kernel as long as we pass the weight matrix as (in_features, out_features) (i.e., transpose the weight) to the kernel? 

   But note: the original weight should be (out_features, in_features) and we are using B_transposed = (in_features, out_features). 

   Alternatively, we could design a kernel that uses the A and the original weight (without transpose) and does a Gemm with transpose_B=true.

   Let me look at the example tilegemm example:

      @T.prim_func
      def main(A: T, B: T, C: T): ... T.gemm(A, B, C, transpose_B=True) ...

   So, we can use the same matmul kernel but set the arguments to:

      kernel(A, B_transposed, C)

   But note, the kernel is built once at startup and the sizes are fixed. However, in our case, we cannot pass the weight without transpose because the kernel is built with hardcoded sizes.

   Alternatively, we can build a kernel that does:

        T.gemm(A, B, C, transpose_B=True)

   and the arguments are:

        A: (batch_size, in_features)   -> M, K
        B: (out_features, in_features) -> then transposed, so we set B's second dimension to be in_features? Actually, no.

   The standard Gemm in TileLang has:

        T.gemm(A: (M, K), B: (K, N), C: (M, N), transpose_B: bool)

   If we set transpose_B=True, then the second matrix becomes (N, K) but note: the second matrix in the standard Gemm is (K, N) for A and B without transpose. If we set transpose_B=True, then B is instead (N, K) but then the multiplication is (M, K) @ (N, K) which is not defined.

   Actually, the standard Gemm requires the first matrix to be (M, K) and the second to be (K, N) for without transpose. With transpose_B=true, the second matrix is (N, K) but then the multiplication is (M, K) @ (N, K) which is only defined if N==K and produces (M, N). 

   Alternatively, another way to think: the multiplication A @ B.t() without transpose_B is the same as A @ P(B, dim=1) with permuted dimensions. But in TileLang, we can do:

        T.gemm(A, B, C, transpose_B=True)

   Then, note: the first matrix is (M, K) and the second matrix is (K, N) but after transpose_B=true, it becomes (N, K) and we get (M, N). But wait, the standard Gemm with transpose_B=true expects:

        For input A: (M, K)
        B: (N, K) and we compute C = A @ B but now the second dimension of A is equal to the first dimension of B? No: without transpose_B, we require the second dimension of A (K) to match the first dimension of B (K). With transpose_B, we require the second dimension of A (K) to match the second dimension of B (K) and the output is (M, N) where N is the first dimension of B (if transpose_B, then the first dimension of the original B is N and after transpose the matrix becomes (N, K) so the output is (M, N) which matches.

   But note: we are using B_transposed in the standard Gemm without transpose_B, and the standard Gemm expects the second matrix to have the second dimension (N) as the output dimension and the first dimension (N) must match the second dimension of the first matrix (K) only if transpose_B is false. 

   So, let me clarify: 

        Without transpose_B: 
            A is (M, K)
            B is (K, N)   -> multiply: C is (M, N)

        With transpose_B=true:
            A is (M, K)
            B is (C, D)   -> becomes (D, C) and we require C to be the same as the second dimension of A (K). Then we get:
            C = A @ (B without transpose).t() 
            This requires that the second dimension of A (K) matches the first dimension of B (D) and the output is (M, C)

   In our case, we want to use the weight matrix as (out_features, in_features) and we want to multiply
