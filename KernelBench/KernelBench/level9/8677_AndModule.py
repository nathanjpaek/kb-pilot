    Extended Summary
    ---------------- 
    An :class:`AndModule` is a neural module that takes two input attention masks and (basically)
    performs a set intersection. This would be used in a question like "What color is the cube to
    the left of the sphere and right of the yellow cylinder?" After localizing the regions left of
    the sphere and right of the yellow cylinder, an :class:`AndModule` would be used to find the
    intersection of the two. Its output would then go into an :class:`AttentionModule` that finds
    cubes.
