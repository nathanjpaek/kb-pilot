class CoreNetwork(nn.Module):
    """
    An RNN that maintains an internal state that integrates
    information extracted from the history of past observations.
    It encodes the agent's knowledge of the environment through
    a state vector `h_t` that gets updated at every time step `t`.

    Concretely, it takes the glimpse representation `g_t` as input,
    and combines it with its internal state `h_t_prev` at the previous
    time step, to produce the new internal state `h_t` at the current
    time step.

    In other words:

        `h_t = relu( fc(h_t_prev) + fc(g_t) )`

    Args
    ----
    - input_size: input size of the rnn.
    - hidden_size: hidden size of the rnn.
    - g_t: a 2D tensor of shape (B, hidden_size). The glimpse
      representation returned by the glimpse network for the
      current timestep `t`.
    - h_t_prev: a 2D tensor of shape (B, hidden_size). The
      hidden state vector for the previous timestep `t-1`.

    Returns
    -------
    - h_t: a 2D tensor of shape (B, hidden_size). The hidden
      state vector for the current timestep `t`.
