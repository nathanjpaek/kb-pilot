    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    An :class:`OrModule` is a neural module that takes two input attention masks and (basically)
    performs a set union. This would be used in a question like "How many cubes are left of the
    brown sphere or right of the cylinder?" After localizing the regions left of the brown sphere
    and right of the cylinder, an :class:`OrModule` would be used to find the union of the two. Its
    output would then go into an :class:`AttentionModule` that finds cubes.
